# TODO: Consider whether there a better way to deal with this (without making a GUI - may do later)

'''
TODO: Deal with posibility of words from key_set used within a string in query, 
i.e. NOT as keywords, so would NOT want to mod, e.g. 2nd 'is' in the following...
select first_name, last_name, gender from patients where gender is 'M is gender';
[Iteration 4 was dead end with shelx.split() - does not preserve quotation marks]

Note1: Using the optional arg type specifier has the advantage of allowing
IDE to make builtin method suggestions on typing dot after string etc.
