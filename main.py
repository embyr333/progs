# Example
upper_SQL_keywords("select first_name, last_name, gender FROM patients where gender is 'M';")
print()
# SELECT first_name, last_name, gender FROM patients WHERE gender IS 'M';

# If query uses single (or no) quotes internally, paste between the single quotes here...
upper_SQL_keywords("select first_name, last_name, gender from patients where gender is 'M is gender';")
# Otherwise can use...
upper_SQL_keywords('')
# TODO: Consider whether there a better way to deal with this (without making a GUI - may do later)

Note1: To deal with posibility of words from key_set used within a string in query, 
i.e. NOT as keywords, so would NOT want to mod, e.g. 2nd 'is' in the following...
select first_name, last_name, gender from patients where gender is 'M is gender';
...using shlex.split() instead of string's split() to preserve quoted substrings. Thanks to folks at 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79968/split-a-string-by-spaces-preserving-quoted-substrings-in-python
Update: bah, just realised that the quote characters themselves are lost!

Note2: Using the optional arg type specifier has the advantage of allowing
IDE to make builtin method suggestions on typing dot after string etc.
