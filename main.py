print()

# Example2 - a value in quotation marks has a word from keyword that should not be processed as a keyword
upper_SQL_keywords("select first_name, last_name, gender from patients where gender is 'M is gender';")
# SELECT first_name, last_name, gender FROM patients WHERE gender IS 'M is gender';

# Paste input between the (double) quotes here...

# TODO: Further test cases will be tried as I use it (and of course add further items to key_set)

'''
Done in this iteration: Dealt with posibility of words from key_set used within a string in query, 
i.e. NOT as keywords, so would NOT want to mod, e.g. 2nd 'is' in the following...
select first_name, last_name, gender from patients where gender is 'M is gender';
[Iteration 4 was dead end with shelx.split() - does not preserve quotation marks]
The whole thing is now rather messy, with some (inefficient) string concatenation, 
and might be better tried with regex, but this approach is probably good enough for now.


Note1: Using the optional arg type specifier has the advantage of allowing
IDE to make builtin method suggestions on typing dot after string etc.
